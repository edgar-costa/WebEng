NOTE: you have to put the folder “onePager” in wordpress>wp-content->themes


Things that are still missing:

- Background color (see Exercise 3.1 description)
- Portfolio Filter (All/UI DESIGN/ANDROID PAGE)
- Responsiveness: the styles for the smaller screens are not being loaded right now. I still haven’t looked up how to do it. One option would append media queries in style.css and add them there. That would work but the file would get huge.
- The contact Section at the bottom with the three columns has some weird styling. 
- The transitions from the left and from the bottom that are triggered from transitions.js are not working. Javascripts file still need to be included. Same thing for the the nav bar with the timers. 



Some things I did: 

—sections and pages-

I split up all the html in different files named page-<nameOfSection>. 
The only two exceptions are header.php which is the nav-bar + the header. 
and footer which is the actual footer + the contact form. 
Header, footer and all pages(=sections) are loaded from index.php

Before you run the code you have to make one page for every section in the wordpress dashboard. The title field and the content field are then used to populate the section (see code in section about for example to understand). 
The important thing is that ‘pagename’ in my code matches the field post_name in the we_posts table of the database that is automatically created for the website. 


-blog-
works fine

—Header Caption- 
	Whatever you write in the field “Tagline” in the Dashboard under Setting>General will appear as the caption in the header.
